      built with Rust using Serenity and Poise, and uses PostgreSQL for data
      storage. I'm building it without as hardcoding as much as possible, so it
      can be easily expanded to other transit agencies. I started this project
      in January, so it's still a work in progress, but I'm excited to see where
      it goes.
